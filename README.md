# FashionGAN: Generate Clothing Images from Fashion-MNIST with Manual Testing Approach

This repository implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) designed to generate synthetic clothing images using the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The project emphasizes a manual testing approach to evaluate and improve the quality of generated images.

## Features

- **GAN Architecture**: Employs deep learning techniques for realistic clothing image generation.
- **Dataset**: Utilizes the popular Fashion-MNIST dataset for model training and evaluation.
- **Manual Testing**: Focuses on hands-on inspection and testing of generated results to ensure quality.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: The codebase is primarily written in Jupyter Notebook for ease of experimentation and visualization.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yadavanujkumar/FashionGAN-Generate-Clothing-Images-Fashion-MNIST-with-manual-testing-approach.git
   ```
2. Install required dependencies (see notebooks for specifics).
3. Run the Jupyter Notebooks to train and evaluate the GAN.
